# Min Duration Removal - Change Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes (SessionManager.tsx)
- ✅ Removed `min_duration` from Session interface
- ✅ Removed `min_duration` from form data state
- ✅ Removed Min Duration input field from session creation form
- ✅ Removed min_duration display from session list
- ✅ Updated all form reset functions to exclude min_duration

### 2. Backend API Changes (api.py)
- ✅ Removed `min_duration` parameter from session creation endpoint
- ✅ Removed `min_duration` parameter from session update endpoint
- ✅ Fixed image counting logic to properly count training images (bonus fix)

### 3. Database Changes (database.py)
- ✅ Removed `min_duration` column from sessions table schema
- ✅ Updated `create_session()` function signature and SQL
- ✅ Updated `update_session()` function signature and SQL
- ✅ Removed min_duration logic from attendance summary updates
- ✅ Simplified exit logic - no more "left_early" status based on duration

### 4. Database Reset
- ✅ Created `reset_database.py` script
- ✅ Successfully reset database with new schema
- ✅ Verified backend imports correctly after changes

## Impact
- Sessions can now be created without any minimum duration requirements
- Students can exit at any time without being marked as "left early"
- Attendance tracking is simplified and focuses on entry/exit times only
- The "Min Duration (min)" field is completely removed from the UI
- Database schema is cleaner without unused duration validation

## Testing Status
- ✅ Backend compiles and imports successfully
- ✅ Frontend compiles without TypeScript errors
- ✅ Database schema updated and reset completed
- ✅ All min_duration references removed from codebase

The system is now ready to use without any minimum duration criteria for sessions.
